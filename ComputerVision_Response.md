I find it really interesting that the author starts the piece by explaining that computer vision is often considered to be an area of high-end Computer Science research. I find this really interesting, because it talks about how creative applications could lead to developments in research fields. People often times look down on the arts because they believe that they are a waste of time, but in fact by using artistic practice to push certain media and techniques to their limits, new knowledge can be created. I know that there is still much research to be done in computer vision, but who knows, maybe some times it will be artists who open the doors to the development of new and more effective algorithms, thus continuing to push on what is possible.
