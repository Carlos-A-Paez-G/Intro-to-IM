The part about Hamilton having her daughter sleep in the floor of her office really popped out to me. It often seems that having a family means sacrificing some level of independence, or that it means that one's focus is now going to be in the family rather than "the work". But this, even though it might sound attrocious to some, sounds very inspirational to me. It's like she and her daughter were a team. I mean, the daughter didn't do much, but she needed to cooperate. Changing the world takes a lot of time and effort, but so does being a normal, functional human. So if there is a way to do these two at once, why not do that?
