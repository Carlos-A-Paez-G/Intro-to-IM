To me, the biggest revelation to learning coding and computing does not really have to do with learning how to look at things around me in a more methodical way (though that is a big advantage). Instead, the biggest gift coding has given me is a demystification of how computers work. Even though I am still very much a beginner when it comes to coding, I feel that I am already able to start reaching out to many things that were unreachable before. The fact that there are large communities out there that have asked and solved many problems out there related to coding, means that there is a lot I can learn to do simply via the internet. Computers are incredibly useful because they are able to streamline interactions and computations that would otherwise be too complicated, and to feel that this possibility is now at my reach is incredibly empowering. I feel like these are skills I should have obtained a long time ago.
